Ling Jin @ uOttawa, April 27, 2015

# Features

The APP manages course projects. A project may consist of information such as course name, description, team members, start time and due date. A project can be further devided into tasks which also consist of information such as task name, start time and due date.

The APP lists the projects which are due in 2 days and plays background music when it starts. All the projects will be shown as default. The detail project information and task list will be shown when a project is selected. A further button click enables the editing UI.

There are also additional functionalities available. For example, exporting or importing a project, changing the priority of a project, sorting the project based on different factors.

# Todo's

The visible position of the list view in the editing activity always goes to the top of the view in the outer layer...

The current work mainly focus on the UI of the APP. Some user(team member) management functions may make the APP easier to use.
